Default method in interface:
-------------------------------
* Like regular interface methods, default methods are implicitly public; there's no need to specify the public modifier.
* Unlike regular interface methods, we declare them with the default keyword at the beginning of the method signature, 
  and they provide an implementation.

  
The reason why the Java 8 release included default methods:
-------------------------------------------------------------
* an interface has one or multiple implementations, if one or more methods are added to the interface, all the 
  implementations will be forced to implement them too. Otherwise, the design will just break down. Default interface 
  methods are an efficient way to deal with this issue.
* They allow us to add new methods to an interface that are automatically available in the implementations.
